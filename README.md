- PLEASE NOTE - There are new requirements and new config options - v0.6.0 updates many required library versions and brings us into alignment with the 2.7 branch of the Meshtastic Python library!  Old configs should work out of the box - but there are new config flags and a new "description" feature for custom commands in commands_config.json.  Read the changelogs.

- Having issues getting up and running?  As of v0.6.0 I have created a custom GPT with Open-AI to assist anyone having problems - give it a try! - https://chatgpt.com/g/g-68d86345f4c4819183c417b3790499c7-mesh-api-setup-assistant

**MESH-API** is an experimental project that bridges [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/) LoRa mesh networks with powerful AI chatbots and 3rd party APIs.

## What Sets MESH-API Apart?

Most projects in this space stop at being "AI chatbot integrations" — but **MESH-API is much more than that.**

- **Full Router / Mesh Operator**  
  MESH-API isn’t just talking to an LLM. It’s a **protocol bridge** and **mesh backbone**, designed to let LoRa networks, online (or offline) services, and APIs talk to each other in real time.

- **Not a One-Trick Pony**  
  Where other tools simply connect to AI, MESH-API is built to **route, translate, and post messages** between different systems and services — making it a true hub for both on-grid and off-grid communication.

- **Expandable by Design**  
  Any software with a working API can be integrated. That means you can merge in external services, dashboards, or automation platforms, extending the mesh far beyond its original scope.

- **AI-Powered Off-Grid Networks**  
  MESH-API provides the foundation for **self-sufficient LoRa mesh networks enhanced with AI**, ensuring communication, automation, and decision-making remain possible — even without the internet.

In short, MESH-API bridges the gap between **mesh services** and **online/locally hosted services**, making it a powerful backbone for resilient, intelligent LoRa networks.

> **Disclaimer:**  
> This project is **NOT ASSOCIATED** with the official Meshtastic Project. It is provided solely as an extension to add AI and advanced features to your Mesh network.  

> **Release Candidate Warning:**  
> This version (v0.6.0 RC1) is a release candidate — nearly feature-complete and approaching the full release. While significantly more stable than earlier pre-releases, some features may still have rough edges. Please avoid relying on it for mission‑critical tasks or emergencies. Always have backup communication methods available and use responsibly.

## Features

- **Plugin-Based Extensions System** *(New in v0.6.0)*  
  - 30 built-in extensions across 7 categories: Communication, Notifications, Emergency/Weather, Ham Radio/Off-Grid, Smart Home, Mesh Bridging, and AI Agents.
  - Drop-in plugin architecture — add or remove extensions by copying a folder. No core code changes required.
  - Extensions can register slash commands, react to emergencies, observe messages, expose HTTP endpoints, and run background services.
  - **WebUI Extensions Manager** — view, enable/disable, and configure extensions from the dashboard.
  - See the [Extensions Reference](#extensions-reference) section below for full details on all built-in extensions, or [Developing Custom Extensions](#developing-custom-extensions) to build your own.
- **Multiple AI Providers**  
  - Support for **Local** models (LM Studio, Ollama), **OpenAI**, **Claude**, **Gemini**, **Grok**, **OpenRouter**, **Groq**, **DeepSeek**, **Mistral**, generic OpenAI-compatible endpoints, and **Home Assistant** integration.
- **Home Assistant Integration**  
  - Seamlessly forward messages from a designated channel to Home Assistant’s conversation API. Optionally secure the integration using a PIN.
- **NASA Space Weather Monitoring**  
  - Track geomagnetic storms, solar flares, coronal mass ejections, and more via NASA's DONKI API. Auto-broadcast significant events to the mesh with configurable Kp index and flare class thresholds. Slash commands: `/spaceweather`, `/solarflare`, `/geomagstorm`.
- **n8n Workflow Automation**  
  - Bidirectional bridge with [n8n](https://n8n.io) — forward mesh messages and emergencies to n8n webhook triggers, receive workflow outputs on the mesh, list active workflows, and trigger them via slash commands. Enables powerful no-code automation pipelines for your mesh network.
- **Advanced Slash Commands**  
  - Built‑in commands: suffixed `/about-XY`, `/help-XY`, `/motd-XY`, `/whereami-XY`, `/nodes-XY`, AI commands with your unique suffix (e.g., `/ai-XY`, `/bot-XY`, `/query-XY`, `/data-XY`), unsuffixed `/test`, and unsuffixed `/emergency` (or `/911`), plus custom commands via `commands_config.json`.
  - Commands are now case‑insensitive for improved mobile usability.
  - New: a per-install randomized alias (e.g. `/ai-9z`) is generated on first run to reduce collisions when multiple bots exist on the same mesh or MQTT network. You can change it in `config.json` (field `ai_command`). All AI commands require this suffix, and other built‑ins (except emergency/911) also require your suffix.
  - Strongly encouraged: customize your commands in `commands_config.json` to avoid collisions with other users.
- **Emergency Alerts**  
  - Trigger alerts that are sent via **Twilio SMS**, **SMTP Email**, and, if enabled, **Discord**.
  - Emergency notifications include GPS coordinates, UTC timestamps, and user messages.
- **Enhanced REST API & WebUI Dashboard**  
  - A modern three‑column layout showing direct messages, channel messages, and available nodes. Stacks on mobile; 3‑wide on desktop. Controls (Suffix, Commands, Config, Logs) live in the “Send a Message” header (top‑right).
  - Additional endpoints include `/messages`, `/nodes`, `/connection_status`, `/logs`, `/logs_stream`, `/send`, `/ui_send`, `/commands_info` (JSON commands list), and a new `/discord_webhook` for inbound Discord messages.
  - UI customization through settings such as theme color, hue rotation, notification sounds (built-in beep or custom file), and volume control.
  - Config Editor (WebUI): Click the “Config” button in the header to view/edit `config.json`, `commands_config.json`, and `motd.json` in a tabbed editor. JSON is validated before saving; writes are atomic. Some changes may require a restart to take effect.
  - Emoji enhancements: each message has a React button that reveals a compact, hidden emoji picker; choosing an emoji auto‑sends a reaction (DM or channel). The send form includes a Quick Emoji bar that inserts emojis into your draft (does not auto‑send).
  - Extensions Manager (WebUI): Click the "Extensions" button to view extension status, enable/disable extensions, edit extension configs, and hot-reload all extensions — all from the browser.
- **Improved Message Chunking & Routing**  
  - Automatically splits long AI responses into configurable chunks with delays to reduce radio congestion.
  - Configurable flags control whether the bot replies to broadcast channels and/or direct messages.
  - New: LongFast (channel 0) response toggle — by default the bot will NOT respond on LongFast to avoid congestion. Enable `ai_respond_on_longfast` only if your local mesh agrees.
  - Etiquette: Using AI bots on public LongFast is discouraged; keep it off unless you’re on an isolated/private mesh with community consent.
- **Robust Error Handling & Logging**  
  - Uses UTC‑based timestamps with an auto‑truncating script log file (keeping the last 100 lines if the file grows beyond 100 MB).
  - Enhanced error detection (including specific OSError codes) and graceful reconnection using threaded exception hooks.
- **Discord Integration Enhancements**  
  - Route messages to and from Discord.
  - New configuration options and a dedicated `/discord_webhook` endpoint allow for inbound Discord message processing.
  - MQTT-aware response gating: set `respond_to_mqtt_messages` to true in `config.json` if you want the bot to respond to messages that arrive via MQTT. Off by default to prevent multiple server responses.
  - User‑initiated only: The AI does not auto‑message or greet new nodes; it responds only to explicit user input.
- **Commands modal & startup helper**
  - WebUI includes a Commands modal (button in the “Send a Message” header) that lists available commands with descriptions.
  - The current alias suffix and a one‑line commands list are printed at startup for easy reference.
- **Windows & Linux Focused**
  - Official support for Windows environments with installation guides; instructions for Linux available now - MacOS coming soon!

## Quick Start (Docker)

1. **Prerequisites**  
   - Docker installed on your host (Linux, macOS, Windows or Raspberry Pi).  (Current Images Built for Linux x86 & ARM64 Raspberry Pi)
   - Docker support is currently untested on Windows & MacOS, and the Raspberry Pi image remains fresh and untested - please report back!
   - A Meshtastic device connected via USB, WiFi, or Bluetooth (BLE)
   - If needed, uncomment USB sections and set identifiers such as `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `\\.\COM3`.

2. **Prepare the Volume Structure**  
   - In the root of your project directory:
  - Extract the "docker-required-volumes.zip" - The included "config" & "logs" folders should be within your "mesh-api folder"
   - This file structure differs from the standard release to accommodate volumes for docker
   - These files are placed in order to prevent docker from replacing these with directories on first start and throwing errors.
   - Make any changes to config files as needed before moving forward.

File structure should look like this:

   ```bash
  mesh-api/
   ├── config/
   │   ├── config.json
   │   ├── commands_config.json
   │   └── motd.json
   └── logs/
    ├── script.log
    ├── messages.log
    └── messages_archive.json
```


3. **Pull & run the Docker Image using docker-compose**
   - An example docker-compose-yaml is included in the github repository - please adjust as needed.
   - From the project directory, run:
   ```bash
  docker pull mrtbot/mesh-api:latest
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Access the WebUI Dashboard:**  
   - Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:5000/dashboard](http://localhost:5000/dashboard).

## Supported Mesh Networks

MESH-API supports **two mesh radio platforms** that can operate independently or be **bridged together** for cross-network communication.

### Meshtastic (Primary)

[Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/) is MESH-API's primary mesh network. Connection is handled automatically by the core — just plug in your Meshtastic device and configure the connection method in `config.json`.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `use_wifi` | Set `true` to connect via TCP/WiFi instead of USB serial |
| `wifi_host` | IP address of your Meshtastic node (when using WiFi) |
| `wifi_port` | TCP port (default `4403`) |
| `serial_port` | USB serial port (e.g. `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `COM3`) — leave empty for auto-detect |
| `serial_baud` | Baud rate (default `460800`) |
| `use_mesh_interface` | Set `true` for direct MeshInterface mode (no serial/WiFi) |

**All MESH-API features** — AI commands, slash commands, emergency alerts, extensions, WebUI dashboard — work natively over the Meshtastic connection.

### MeshCore (Extension-Based Bridge)

[MeshCore](https://meshcore.co.uk/) is a lightweight, multi-hop LoRa mesh firmware focused on embedded packet routing. MESH-API supports MeshCore through the **MeshCore extension** (`extensions/meshcore/`), which connects to a **separate** MeshCore companion-firmware device.

> **Hardware requirement:** You need **two separate LoRa devices** — one running Meshtastic (connected to MESH-API core) and one running MeshCore companion firmware (connected to the MeshCore extension via USB serial or TCP/WiFi). Each device has its own independent radio settings.

#### How It Works

```
┌──────────────┐           ┌──────────────┐           ┌──────────────┐
│  Meshtastic  │◀── USB ──▶│   MESH-API   │◀── USB ──▶│   MeshCore   │
│    Device    │  or WiFi  │   (Server)   │  or TCP   │   Companion  │
│              │           │              │           │    Device    │
└──────┬───────┘           └──────┬───────┘           └──────┬───────┘
       │                          │                          │
  Meshtastic                 Bridges chat              MeshCore
  Mesh Network              + commands                 Mesh Network
```

- **Bidirectional chat bridging** — Messages flow between configurable Meshtastic and MeshCore channels, tagged with their origin (`[MC]` for MeshCore, `[MT]` for Meshtastic) to show where each message came from.
- **Full command support** — MeshCore users can issue the same `/slash` commands that Meshtastic users can (AI queries, `/help`, `/emergency`, custom commands, etc.).
- **Direct message support** — Optionally bridge DMs between the two networks.
- **Emergency relay** — Emergency alerts triggered on either network are forwarded to the other.
- **Independent command processing** — MeshCore users get AI responses sent directly back to their MeshCore device without needing to go through Meshtastic.

#### MeshCore Quick Setup

1. **Install the MeshCore Python library:**
   ```bash
   pip install meshcore
   ```
   *(This is already included in `requirements.txt`)*

2. **Flash a companion device** with MeshCore companion firmware:
   - Visit [https://flasher.meshcore.co.uk](https://flasher.meshcore.co.uk)
   - Flash the **Companion** firmware type (Serial or WiFi variant depending on your setup)

3. **Enable the extension** — edit `extensions/meshcore/config.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "enabled": true,
     "connection_type": "serial",
     "serial_port": "COM5",
     "serial_baud": 115200,
     "bridge_enabled": true,
     "bridge_meshcore_channel_to_meshtastic_channel": { "0": 1 },
     "bridge_meshtastic_channels_to_meshcore_channel": { "1": 0 }
   }
   ```

4. **Restart MESH-API** — the extension will connect to the MeshCore device and begin bridging.

5. **Verify** — use the `/meshcore` command from either network, or visit `http://localhost:5000/api/meshcore/status`.

#### Channel Mapping

Channel mapping is defined by two config keys:

- **`bridge_meshcore_channel_to_meshtastic_channel`** — Maps MeshCore channel numbers to Meshtastic channel numbers. Example: `{"0": 1}` means MeshCore public channel 0 bridges to Meshtastic channel 1.
- **`bridge_meshtastic_channels_to_meshcore_channel`** — The reverse direction. Example: `{"1": 0}` means Meshtastic channel 1 bridges to MeshCore channel 0.

You can map multiple channels in each direction:
```json
{
  "bridge_meshcore_channel_to_meshtastic_channel": { "0": 1, "1": 2 },
  "bridge_meshtastic_channels_to_meshcore_channel": { "1": 0, "2": 1 }
}
```

#### Echo Prevention

The extension includes multiple layers of loop prevention:
- **Origin tags** (`[MC]` / `[MT]`) — messages carrying these tags are recognized as bridged and not re-bridged.
- **AI prefix detection** — AI-generated responses are not echoed back.
- **Rolling buffer** — a buffer of the last 50 bridged messages prevents exact duplicates.

#### Connection Types

| Type | Config | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| USB Serial | `"connection_type": "serial"` | Direct USB connection to a MeshCore companion device |
| TCP/WiFi | `"connection_type": "tcp"` | Network connection to a WiFi-enabled MeshCore companion |

See the full config reference in the [MeshCore Extension](#meshcore) section below.

### AI Agent Extensions

#### OpenClaw

Bridges the Meshtastic mesh network to an [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.dev) AI agent instance. Mesh users can query the OpenClaw agent via slash commands; the agent can fan-out responses through its own channels (Telegram, Discord, SMS, etc.). Emergency alerts are optionally forwarded to OpenClaw for multi-channel distribution. An optional polling mode injects proactive messages (scheduled alerts, reminders) from OpenClaw into the mesh.

**Commands:**
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/claw-XY` | Query the OpenClaw AI agent (XY = your install suffix) |
| `/agent-XY` | Alias for `/claw-XY` |

**Config (`extensions/openclaw/config.json`):**
| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | bool | `false` | Enable the extension |
| `openclaw_url` | string | `"http://localhost:18789"` | OpenClaw gateway API URL |
| `openclaw_token` | string | `""` | Bearer token for OpenClaw authentication (optional) |

| `forward_emergency` | bool | `true` | Forward `/emergency` alerts to OpenClaw |
| `timeout` | int | `15` | HTTP request timeout in seconds |
| `poll_enabled` | bool | `false` | Poll OpenClaw for proactively queued messages |
| `poll_interval` | int | `30` | Polling interval in seconds |

**Hooks:** `handle_command()` (query agent), `on_emergency()` (forward alerts), `send_message()` (relay tagged messages), `receive_message()` (poll queue).

**Companion Skill:** A MESH-API skill file for OpenClaw is included at `openclaw-release/skills/mesh-api/SKILL.md` — copy it to `~/.openclaw/skills/mesh-api/SKILL.md` to teach an OpenClaw agent how to interact with MESH-API's REST API. If you install the `@mesh-api/openclaw-meshtastic` plugin via npm, the skill ships automatically.

**OpenClaw Community Plugin:** A full OpenClaw-native TypeScript plugin is being prepared for release as `@mesh-api/openclaw-meshtastic` — see the [OpenClaw Integration & Community Plugin](#openclaw-integration--community-plugin) section below for the full plan.

### Extension Management

**Listing Extensions:** Use the `/extensions` command on the mesh to see all loaded extensions and their status.

**Enabling/Disabling:** Edit the extension's `config.json` and set `"enabled": true` or `"enabled": false`, then restart MESH-API.

**Extension Loading:** Extensions are automatically discovered from the `extensions_path` directory (default: `./extensions`). Each subfolder containing an `extension.py` file is loaded. Folders starting with `_` (like `_example`) are skipped.

---

## Developing Custom Extensions

> A step-by-step guide for building custom extensions for the MESH-API plugin system.

### Overview

MESH-API uses a plugin-based extension system where each extension is a self-contained Python package that lives in the `extensions/` directory. Extensions can:

- Register slash commands accessible from the mesh network
- Send and receive messages to/from the mesh
- React to emergency broadcasts
- Observe all inbound mesh messages
- Expose HTTP endpoints via Flask
- Run background threads for polling external services
- Act as AI providers

Extensions are automatically discovered and loaded at startup. No changes to core code are required.

### Quick Start (Extensions)

1. **Copy the template:**
   ```bash
   cp -r extensions/_example extensions/my_extension
   ```

2. **Edit the three files:**
   - `__init__.py` — leave empty (marks the folder as a Python package)
   - `config.json` — define your settings (must include `"enabled": true`)
   - `extension.py` — implement your extension class

3. **Restart MESH-API** — your extension is auto-discovered and loaded.

4. **Verify** — send `/extensions` on the mesh to see it listed.

### Extension Structure

Every extension lives in its own subfolder under `extensions/`:

```
extensions/
├── base_extension.py        # Abstract base class (DO NOT MODIFY)
├── loader.py                 # Extension loader (DO NOT MODIFY)
├── __init__.py
└── my_extension/             # Your extension folder
    ├── __init__.py           # Empty file (required)
    ├── config.json           # Extension configuration
    └── extension.py          # Extension implementation
```

**Naming Rules:**
- Folder names must be valid Python identifiers (lowercase, underscores OK)
- Folders starting with `_` are **skipped** by the loader (used for templates)
- The class inside `extension.py` must subclass `BaseExtension`
- Class name convention: `<Name>Extension` (e.g. `MyExtension`)

### Base Class API Reference

Every extension inherits from `BaseExtension`. Here's the complete API:

**Constructor (automatic):**

```python
def __init__(self, extension_dir: str, app_context: dict):
```

You do **not** override `__init__`. The base class handles:
- `self.extension_dir` — absolute path to your extension's folder
- `self.app_context` — shared dict with core helpers (see below)
- `self._config` — loaded from your `config.json`

**Required Properties (must override):**

| Property | Returns | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | `str` | Human-readable name (e.g. `"My Extension"`) |
| `version` | `str` | Semantic version (e.g. `"1.0.0"`) |

**Built-in Properties (inherited):**

| Property | Returns | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `bool` | `config["enabled"]` — the loader checks this |
| `commands` | `dict` | Slash commands to register (override to add) |
| `config` | `dict` | Read-only access to loaded config |

**Lifecycle Hooks:**

| Method | When Called |
|--------|------------|
| `on_load()` | Once after instantiation at startup |
| `on_unload()` | On shutdown or before hot-reload |

**Message Hooks:**

| Method | Signature | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| `send_message()` | `(message: str, metadata: dict \| None)` | Outbound: mesh → external service |
| `receive_message()` | `()` | Inbound polling (prefer background threads) |
| `handle_command()` | `(command: str, args: str, node_info: dict) → str \| None` | Handle a registered slash command |
| `on_emergency()` | `(message: str, gps_coords: dict \| None)` | Emergency broadcast hook |
| `on_message()` | `(message: str, metadata: dict \| None)` | Observe all inbound mesh messages |

**Flask Integration:**

| Method | Signature | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| `register_routes()` | `(app: Flask)` | Register HTTP endpoints |

**Helper Methods:**

| Method | Signature | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| `send_to_mesh()` | `(text, channel_index=None, destination_id=None)` | Send a message to the mesh network |
| `log()` | `(message: str)` | Write to the MESH-API script log |
| `_save_config()` | `()` | Persist config changes to disk |

**app_context Dict:**

The `app_context` dict provides access to core functionality:

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `interface` | `MeshInterface` | The Meshtastic serial/TCP/BLE interface |
| `send_broadcast_chunks` | `function(iface, text, channel_idx)` | Send broadcast message |
| `send_direct_chunks` | `function(iface, text, destination_id)` | Send direct message |
| `add_script_log` | `function(message)` | Core logging function |
| `flask_app` | `Flask` | The Flask application instance |
| `config` | `dict` | Main `config.json` contents |

### Step-by-Step Tutorial

**1. Create the folder structure:**

```
extensions/my_sensor/
├── __init__.py          # Empty
├── config.json
└── extension.py
```

**2. Define config.json:**

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "sensor_url": "http://localhost:9000/api/reading",
  "poll_interval_seconds": 300,
  "broadcast_channel_index": 0,
  "unit": "°F"
}
```

The only required key is `"enabled"`. Everything else is up to you.

**3. Implement extension.py:**

```python
"""My Sensor extension — reads temperature from a local sensor API."""

import threading
import time

try:
    import requests
except ImportError:
    requests = None

from extensions.base_extension import BaseExtension


class MySensorExtension(BaseExtension):

    @property
    def name(self) -> str:
        return "My Sensor"

    @property
    def version(self) -> str:
        return "1.0.0"

    @property
    def commands(self) -> dict:
        return {
            "/temp": "Read the current temperature",
        }

    def on_load(self) -> None:
        self._stop = threading.Event()
        self.log(f"My Sensor loaded. URL: {self.config.get('sensor_url')}")

    def on_unload(self) -> None:
        self._stop.set()
        self.log("My Sensor unloaded.")

    def handle_command(self, command: str, args: str,
                       node_info: dict) -> str | None:
        if command == "/temp":
            return self._read_sensor()
        return None

    def _read_sensor(self) -> str:
        url = self.config.get("sensor_url", "")
        unit = self.config.get("unit", "°F")
        if not url:
            return "Sensor URL not configured."
        try:
            resp = requests.get(url, timeout=5)
            data = resp.json()
            temp = data.get("temperature", "?")
            return f"🌡️ Current temperature: {temp}{unit}"
        except Exception as exc:
            return f"⚠️ Sensor error: {exc}"
```

**4. Test it:**

1. Restart MESH-API
2. Send `/extensions` on mesh — should show "My Sensor v1.0.0 [enabled]"
3. Send `/temp` — should return the temperature reading

### Hook Reference

**handle_command(command, args, node_info) → str | None**

The most commonly used hook. Called when a mesh user sends one of your registered commands.

```python
def handle_command(self, command: str, args: str, node_info: dict) -> str | None:
    if command == "/mycmd":
        sender = node_info.get("shortname", "?")
        return f"Hello {sender}! You said: {args}"
    return None  # Not our command
```

**node_info dict:**
```python
{
    "node_id": "!abcd1234",      # Hex node ID
    "shortname": "ABC",          # 4-char node short name
    "longname": "Alpha Bravo",   # Full node name
    "channel_index": 0,          # Channel the message arrived on
    "is_direct": False,          # True if DM, False if broadcast
}
```

**Return value:**
- `str` — text sent back to the mesh (broadcast or DM depending on context)
- `None` — command not handled, loader passes to next extension

**on_message(message, metadata)**

Read-only observer hook. Called for **every** inbound mesh message. Use for logging, analytics, keyword scanning, or triggering side-effects.

```python
def on_message(self, message: str, metadata: dict | None = None) -> None:
    if "help" in message.lower():
        self.log(f"Help request detected: {message}")
```

**Do NOT** return a response from `on_message`. Use `handle_command` for responses, or `send_to_mesh()` for async replies.

**on_emergency(message, gps_coords)**

Called when `/emergency` or `/911` is triggered on the mesh.

```python
def on_emergency(self, message: str, gps_coords: dict | None = None) -> None:
    lat = gps_coords.get("lat", "?") if gps_coords else "?"
    lon = gps_coords.get("lon", "?") if gps_coords else "?"
    self.log(f"EMERGENCY at {lat},{lon}: {message}")
    # Forward to your external service here
```

**send_message(message, metadata)**

Outbound hook. Called by the loader when the core wants to push a message to external services.

```python
def send_message(self, message: str, metadata: dict | None = None) -> None:
    requests.post("https://example.com/api", json={"text": message})
```

**register_routes(app)**

Register Flask HTTP endpoints for inbound webhooks or APIs.

```python
def register_routes(self, app) -> None:
    @app.route("/my_extension/webhook", methods=["POST"])
    def my_webhook():
        from flask import request, jsonify
        data = request.get_json()
        message = data.get("message", "")
        self.send_to_mesh(message, channel_index=0)
        return jsonify({"status": "ok"})
```

### Extension Configuration

**Reading Config:**

```python
api_key = self.config.get("api_key", "")
interval = int(self.config.get("poll_interval", 60))
```

**Updating Config at Runtime:**

```python
self._config["last_check"] = "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"
self._save_config()  # Writes to config.json on disk
```

**Config Best Practices:**
- Always provide defaults with `.get(key, default)`
- Include `"enabled": false` as the first key
- Use descriptive key names: `poll_interval_seconds`, `broadcast_channel_index`
- Document every key in your extension's comments or README

### Flask Routes (Extensions)

Extensions can expose HTTP endpoints. The Flask app is passed to `register_routes()`:

```python
def register_routes(self, app) -> None:
    @app.route("/my_ext/data", methods=["GET"])
    def my_data():
        from flask import jsonify
        return jsonify({"status": "ok", "extension": self.name})

    @app.route("/my_ext/inbound", methods=["POST"])
    def my_inbound():
        from flask import request
        data = request.get_json(force=True)
        text = data.get("message", "")
        if text:
            self.send_to_mesh(text)
        return "OK", 200
```

**Rules:**
- Use unique route paths prefixed with your extension name
- Import Flask utilities inside the route functions (avoid circular imports)
- Keep route handlers lightweight

### Background Threads

Many extensions need to poll external services. Use daemon threads:

```python
import threading
import time

class MyExtension(BaseExtension):
    def on_load(self) -> None:
        self._stop = threading.Event()
        self._thread = threading.Thread(
            target=self._poll_loop,
            daemon=True,
            name="my-ext-poll",
        )
        self._thread.start()

    def on_unload(self) -> None:
        self._stop.set()
        if self._thread.is_alive():
            self._thread.join(timeout=10)

    def _poll_loop(self) -> None:
        time.sleep(10)  # Initial delay to let system stabilize

        while not self._stop.is_set():
            try:
                data = self._fetch_data()
                if data:
                    self.send_to_mesh(f"New data: {data}")
            except Exception as exc:
                self.log(f"Poll error: {exc}")

            # Interruptible sleep (checks stop event every second)
            interval = int(self.config.get("poll_interval_seconds", 60))
            for _ in range(interval):
                if self._stop.is_set():
                    break
                time.sleep(1)
```

**Thread Safety Tips:**
- Use `threading.Lock()` if shared state is accessed from multiple threads
- Use `threading.Event()` for clean shutdown signaling
- Use interruptible sleep pattern (loop with 1-second sleeps)
- Always set `daemon=True` so threads don't prevent exit
- Give threads descriptive names

### Extension Best Practices

1. **Guard imports** — wrap optional dependencies in try/except:
   ```python
   try:
       import requests
   except ImportError:
       requests = None
   ```

2. **Handle errors gracefully** — never let exceptions crash the main process:
   ```python
   try:
       result = self._call_api()
   except Exception as exc:
       return f"⚠️ Error: {exc}"
   ```

3. **Respect mesh bandwidth** — keep messages short (< 230 chars if possible). The mesh has limited capacity.

4. **De-duplicate** — track seen message IDs to avoid broadcasting the same alert twice:
   ```python
   if msg_id in self._seen_ids:
       return
   self._seen_ids.add(msg_id)
   ```

5. **Clean up in on_unload()** — stop threads, close sockets, flush buffers.

**Naming Conventions:**
- Folder: `snake_case` (e.g. `my_extension`)
- Class: `PascalCaseExtension` (e.g. `MyExtension`)
- Commands: `/<lowercase>` — avoid collisions with built-in commands
- Config keys: `snake_case` with descriptive names

**Message Formatting — Use emoji prefixes for visual scanning on small screens:**
- 📡 — radio/connectivity
- 🚨 — alerts/emergencies  
- ✅ — success/confirmation
- ⚠️ — warnings/errors
- 📋 — lists/info
- 📧 — email/messages
- 🌡️ — weather/sensors

### Testing Extensions

1. Set `"enabled": true` in your extension's `config.json`
2. Restart MESH-API
3. Check the logs for `[ext:YourName]` entries
4. Send `/extensions` to verify it's loaded
5. Test each command from a mesh node

Your `self.log()` calls appear in the MESH-API script log with the prefix `[ext:YourName]`. Check the WebUI Logs panel or the log file.

### Extension Troubleshooting

**Extension not loading:**
- Check that `extension.py` exists in the folder
- Ensure `__init__.py` exists (even if empty)
- Verify the class inherits from `BaseExtension`
- Check that `name` and `version` properties are defined
- Folder names starting with `_` are ignored intentionally
- Check logs for import errors

**Commands not responding:**
- Verify `commands` property returns a dict with your command
- Check `handle_command()` matches the exact command string
- Make sure no other extension registers the same command
- Confirm `"enabled": true` in your config.json

**send_to_mesh not working:**
- Ensure `app_context` contains a valid `interface`
- Check that the mesh interface is connected
- Verify channel index is valid for your mesh configuration

**Config not loading:**
- Validate JSON syntax in `config.json` (use a JSON linter)
- Check file permissions
- Look for log entries about config load failures

## Changelog

### v0.6.0 RC1 (Release Candidate 1)
- **WebUI Extensions Manager**
  - New "Extensions" button in the dashboard toolbar opens a full Extensions Manager modal.
  - View all available extensions with color-coded status indicators (green=active, yellow=enabled but not loaded, grey=disabled).
  - Enable/disable extensions directly from the WebUI — toggles are saved to each extension's `config.json`.
  - Inline JSON config editor for each extension — edit and save any extension's configuration without touching the filesystem.
  - Hot-Reload button to live-reload all extensions without restarting the server.
  - New REST API endpoints: `GET /extensions/status`, `GET/PUT /extensions/config/<slug>`, `POST /extensions/toggle/<slug>`, `POST /extensions/reload`.
- **Incoming Message Sound — Fixed & Improved**
  - The notification sound system has been completely rewritten. Previously, the `<audio>` element was configured but `.play()` was never called — sounds were non-functional.
  - New built-in two-tone notification beep using the Web Audio API (no external files required).
  - Sound plays automatically when new inbound messages arrive (not for outgoing/WebUI/system messages).
  - New UI Settings controls: enable/disable toggle, volume slider, sound type selector (built-in beep vs. custom file), and a "Test Sound" button.
  - First page load silently seeds the seen-message set so existing messages don't trigger sounds.
- **Config Modal Alignment**
  - Updated config editor help text to reflect the new extension system — removed legacy Discord/Home Assistant references from config.json help.
  - Added note directing users to the Extensions button for extension configuration.
- **Docker Preparation**
  - Updated Dockerfile to include the `extensions/` directory and all built-in extensions.
  - Updated `docker-compose.yml` with optional extensions volume mount.
  - Docker images coming with the full v0.6.0 release!
- **Version Bump**
  - Updated all version references (banner, footer, README, scripts) to v0.6.0 RC1.

### v0.6.0 Release
- **Plugin-Based Extensions System**
  - Brand new drop-in plugin architecture with 26+ built-in extensions across 5 categories: Communication, Notifications, Emergency/Weather, Ham Radio/Off-Grid, and Smart Home.
  - Extensions can register slash commands, react to emergencies, observe all mesh messages, expose HTTP endpoints via Flask, and run background polling threads.
  - Each extension is fully self-contained with its own `config.json` — no core code changes required to add, remove, or configure extensions.
  - New `/extensions` mesh command to list all loaded extensions and their status.
  - **⚠️ The extensions system and all corresponding extensions are new and largely untested. Please report any issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/mr-tbot/mesh-api/issues) so they may be investigated and addressed.**
- **12 AI Providers**
  - Added support for **Claude**, **Gemini**, **Grok**, **OpenRouter**, **Groq**, **DeepSeek**, **Mistral**, and a generic **OpenAI-compatible** endpoint option — in addition to existing LM Studio, OpenAI, Ollama, and Home Assistant providers.
  - All OpenAI-compatible providers share a unified helper for consistent behavior and error handling.
- **Extension Categories**
  - **Communication (12):** Discord, Slack, Telegram, Matrix, Signal, Mattermost, Zello, MQTT, Webhook Generic, IMAP, Mastodon, n8n
  - **Notifications (5):** Apprise, Ntfy, Pushover, PagerDuty, OpsGenie
  - **Emergency/Weather (6):** NWS Alerts, OpenWeatherMap, USGS Earthquakes, GDACS, Amber Alerts, NASA Space Weather
  - **Ham Radio/Off-Grid (3):** Winlink, APRS, BBS (SQLite store-and-forward)
  - **Smart Home (1):** Home Assistant (AI provider extension)
- **Backward Compatibility**
  - Legacy Discord and Home Assistant configuration keys in the main `config.json` are automatically migrated to their respective extension configs on first load.
  - Old configs should work out of the box with the new extension system.
- **Developer Documentation**
  - Full extension development guide with base class API reference, step-by-step tutorial, hook reference, configuration patterns, Flask route examples, background thread patterns, best practices, and troubleshooting.

### v0.6.0 Pre-Release 3 (PR3)
- **New `/nodes-XY` command**
  - Reports online nodes (heard within the last window) and total known nodes.
- **Online window config**
  - New `nodes_online_window_sec` setting controls the online window (default 2 hours).
- **Ollama stability limit**
  - New `ollama_max_parallel` setting caps concurrent Ollama requests (default 1).
- **AI command matching improvements**
  - `/ai-XY` works reliably in channels; legacy `/aiXY` is also accepted for compatibility.

### v0.6.0 Pre-Release 2 → Pre-Release 3
- **Mesh safety defaults**
  - LongFast (channel 0) responses are OFF by default; enable `ai_respond_on_longfast` only if your mesh agrees.
  - MQTT response gating: new `respond_to_mqtt_messages` flag (default `false`) to prevent multiple servers from replying at once over MQTT.
  - Community note: Using AI bots on public LongFast channels is generally frowned upon because it increases congestion for everyone. The toggle remains available for isolated/private deployments or special cases, but it is off by default.
- **Bot‑loop prevention**
  - All AI replies now start with a tiny fixed marker `m@i` (≤ 3 chars). Other MESH‑AI instances ignore messages that begin with this marker.
  - Each instance also remembers node IDs that send AI‑tagged messages and ignores further requests from those nodes to mitigate bot‑to‑bot chatter.
- **User‑initiated only**
  - No features are planned that allow the AI to auto‑respond to “join/arrive” events or otherwise talk without an explicit message from a legitimate user.
- **Per‑install command alias**
  - On first run, a randomized alias (e.g. `/ai-9z`) is generated and saved as `ai_command` in `config.json`. Use it to avoid collisions; you can change it anytime.
  - Strongly encouraged: customize your commands in `commands_config.json` to minimize collisions on shared meshes/MQTT.
- **No chain‑of‑thought on mesh**
  - A global sanitizer removes any “thinking”/reasoning content before sending. This includes XML‑style tags (e.g. `<thinking>…</thinking>`), fenced blocks, YAML/JSON meta fields, and heading lines.
  - Applied consistently across all providers (LM Studio, OpenAI, Ollama) and Home Assistant so only final answers are transmitted.
- **Ollama reliability**
  - Added keep‑alive and request options, simple retries on transient failures, and response normalization plus sanitization for cleaner output.
- **WebUI**
  - Fixed ticker behavior: it now correctly honors read/unread state for both DMs and channel messages, and dismissals persist across refreshes.
  - Refined layout: Direct Messages, Channel Messages, and Available Nodes order; mobile stacking with 3‑wide desktop; controls moved to the “Send a Message” header (top‑right).
  - New Commands modal overlay: quickly view available commands and descriptions (via the Commands button). Backed by a lightweight JSON endpoint (`/commands_info`).
  - Scrollable panels with sensible max heights; on mobile, each panel can be collapsed/expanded for easier navigation.
  - Footer badge: "MESH-API v0.6.0" and "by: MR-TBOT".
  - Emoji reactions: every message now includes a React button that toggles a hidden emoji picker; picking an emoji auto‑sends a reaction (works for both DMs and channel messages).
  - Quick Emoji bar: the “Send a Message” form includes common emojis; clicking inserts into your draft at the cursor without auto‑sending.
  - Reaction feedback: React buttons show Sending/Sent/Failed states and temporarily disable during send to prevent accidental double‑presses.
- **Docs & help**
  - Updated README and in‑app `/help` to highlight safety defaults, MQTT gating, and your unique alias.
  - New config keys summarized above; defaults favor safety and reduce congestion.

### v0.4.2 → v0.5.1 - NOW IN BETA!
- **REBRANDED TO MESH-API** 
- **WebUI Enhancements**  
  - **Node Search** added for easier node management.  
  - **Channel Message Organization** with support for custom channels in `config.json`.  
  - **Revamped DM threaded messaging** system.

  - **Timezone Selection** for accurate incoming message timestamps.
  - **Custom Local Sounds** for message notifications (no longer relying on hosted files).
  - **Logs Page Auto-Refresh** for live updates.
- **Baudrate Adjustment**  
  - Configurable **baud rate** in `config.json` for longer USB connections (e.g., roof nodes).
- **LM Studio Model Selection**  
  - Support for selecting models when multiple are loaded in LM Studio, enabling multi-model instances.
- **Protobuf Noise Debugging**  
  - Moved any protobuf-related errors behind debug logs as they do not affect functionality.  
  - Can be enabled by setting `"debug": true` in `config.json` to track.
- **Updated Docker Support**  
  - Updated Docker configuration to always pull/build the latest Meshtastic-Python libraries, ensuring compatibility with Protobuf versions.
### POSSIBLE BUGS IN BETA v0.5.1 - Web UI ticker isn't honoring read messages in some cases.
### INCOMING MESSAGE SOUNDS ARE UNTESTED ON ALL PLATFORMS AND FILESYSTEMS.

### v0.4.1 → v0.4.2
- **Initial Ubuntu & Ollama Unidecode Support: -**  
  - User @milo_o - Thank you so much!  I have merged your idea into the main branch - hoping this works as expected for users - please report any problems!  -  https://github.com/mr-tbot/mesh-api/discussions/19
- **Emergency Email Google Maps Link:**  
  - Emergency email now includes a Google Maps link to the sender's location, rather than just coordinates. - Great call, @Nlantz79!  (Remember - this is only as accurate as the sender node's location precision allows!)

### v0.4.0 → v0.4.1
- **Error Handling (ongoing):**  
  - Trying a new method to handle WinError exceptions - which though much improved in v0.4.0 - still occur under the right connection circumstances - especially over Wi-Fi.  
     (**UPDATE: My WinError issues were being caused by a combination of low solar power, and MQTT being enabled on my node.  MQTT - especially using LongFast is very intense on a node, and can cause abrupt connection restarts as noted here:  https://github.com/meshtastic/meshtastic/pull/901 - but - now the script is super robust regardless for handling errors!)**
- **Emergency Email Subject:**  
  - Email Subject now includes the long name, short name & Node ID of the sending node, rather than just the Node ID.
- **INITIAL Docker Support**

  - Made all slash commands case‑insensitive to improve usability.
  - Enhanced custom command support via `commands_config.json` with dynamic AI prompt insertion.
- **Improved Error Handling & Reconnection:**  
  - More granular detection of connection errors (e.g., specific OSError codes) and use of a global reset event for reconnects.
- **Code Refactoring:**  
  - Overall code improvements for maintainability and clarity, with additional debug prints for troubleshooting.

### Changelog: v0.2.2 → v0.3.0 (from the original Main Branch README)

## 1. Changelog: v0.1 → v0.2.2

- **Expanded Configuration & JSON Files**  
   - **New `config.json` fields**  
     - Added `debug` toggle for verbose debugging.  
     - Added options for multiple AI providers (`lmstudio`, `openai`, `ollama`), including timeouts and endpoints.  
     - Introduced **Home Assistant** integration toggles (`home_assistant_enabled`, `home_assistant_channel_index`, secure pin, etc.).  
     - Implemented **Twilio** and **SMTP** settings for emergency alerts (including phone number, email, and credentials).  
     - Added **Discord** webhook configuration toggles (e.g., `enable_discord`, `discord_send_emergency`, etc.).  
     - Several new user-configurable parameters to control message chunking (`chunk_size`, `max_ai_chunks`, and `chunk_delay`) to reduce radio congestion.  
- **Support for Multiple AI Providers**  
   - **Local Language Models** (LM Studio, Ollama) and **OpenAI** (GPT-3.5, etc.) can be selected via `ai_provider`.  
   - Behavior is routed depending on which provider you specify in `config.json`.
- **Home Assistant Integration**  
   - Option to route messages on a dedicated channel directly to Home Assistant’s conversation API.  
   - **Security PIN** requirement can be enabled, preventing unauthorized control of Home Assistant.  
- **Improved Command Handling**  
   - Replaced single-purpose code with a new, flexible **commands system** loaded from `commands_config.json`.  
   - Users can define custom commands that either have direct string responses or prompt an AI.  
   - Built-in commands now include `/ping`, `/test`, `/emergency`, `/whereami`, `/help`, `/motd`, and more.  
- **Emergency Alert System**  
   - `/emergency` (or `/911`) triggers optional Twilio SMS, SMTP email, and/or Discord alerts.  
   - Retrieves node GPS coordinates (if available) to include location in alerts.  
- **Improved Message Chunking & Throttling**  
   - Long AI responses are split into multiple smaller segments (configurable via `chunk_size` & `max_ai_chunks`).  
   - Delays (`chunk_delay`) between chunks to avoid flooding the mesh network.  
- **REST API Endpoints** (via built-in Flask server)  
   - `GET /messages`: Returns the last 100 messages in JSON.  
   - `GET /dashboard`: Displays a simple HTML dashboard showing the recently received messages.  
   - `POST /send`: Manually send messages to nodes (direct or broadcast) from external scripts or tools.  
- **Improved Logging and File Structure**  
   - **`messages.log`** for persistent logging of all incoming messages, commands, and emergencies.  
   - Distinct JSON config files: `config.json`, `commands_config.json`, and `motd.json`.  
- **Refined Startup & Script Structure**  
  - A new `Run MESH-API - Windows.bat` script for straightforward Windows startup.  
   - Added disclaimers for alpha usage throughout the code.  
   - Streamlined reconnection and exception handling logic with more robust error-handling.

---

## Basic Usage

- **Interacting with the AI:**  
  - Use your randomized alias shown at startup (e.g., `/ai-9z`) — AI commands require the suffix: `/ai-9z`, `/bot-9z`, `/query-9z`, `/data-9z` followed by your message.
  - To avoid collisions (multiple bots responding), prefer your unique alias and/or customize commands in `commands_config.json`.
  - For direct messages, simply DM the AI node if configured to reply.
- **Location Query:**  
  - Send `/whereami-XY` (replace `XY` with your suffix) to retrieve the node’s GPS coordinates (if available).
- **Emergency Alerts:**  
  - Trigger an emergency using `/emergency <message>` or `/911 <message>`.  
    - These commands send alerts via Twilio, SMTP, and Discord (if enabled), including GPS data and timestamps.
- **Sending and receiving SMS:**  
  - Send SMS using your suffixed command, e.g., `/sms-9z <+15555555555> <message>`
  - Config options to either route incoming Twilio SMS messages to a specific node, or a channel index.
- **Home Assistant Integration:**  
  - When enabled, messages sent on the designated Home Assistant channel (as defined by `"home_assistant_channel_index"`) are forwarded to Home Assistant’s conversation API.
  - In secure mode, include the PIN in your message (format: `PIN=XXXX your message`).
- **WebUI Messaging:**  
  - Use the dashboard’s send‑message form to send broadcast or direct messages. The mode toggle and node selection simplify quick replies.

### WebUI Config Editor (new)

- Open the dashboard and click the “Config” button in the header (next to Commands/Logs).
- A tabbed editor appears with three files:
  - `config.json` — core app settings (providers, timeouts, routing, integrations, etc.)
  - `commands_config.json` — custom slash commands and AI prompts
  - `motd.json` — the Message of the Day string shown in the UI
- Make edits and click Save. The editor validates JSON before saving (for JSON files) and writes changes atomically to prevent partial/corrupted updates.
- All `config.json` options are available here since the editor loads and saves the full file.
- Changes to some settings may require restarting the app/container to take effect (e.g., provider, connectivity, or Discord/Twilio credentials).
- Security note: If you expose the WebUI beyond localhost, protect access to the dashboard since configuration files may contain secrets (API keys, tokens).

#### WebUI Config Options (Quick Guide)

The Config Editor includes a grouped help panel. These are the main groups and what they cover:

- **Core**: AI provider selection, system prompt, alias suffix, AI node name, local location string.
- **Diagnostics**: debug logging and message log limits.
- **Providers**: LM Studio, OpenAI, Ollama, and Home Assistant settings.
- **Connectivity**: WiFi, serial, or mesh interface options and advanced node overrides.
- **Policy**: Reply behavior and MQTT response gating.
- **Performance**: Chunk sizing and delays for radio-friendly responses.
- **Channels**: Friendly channel names and `/nodes-XY` online window.
- **Integrations**: Home Assistant, Discord, Twilio, and SMTP credentials and routing.  (future home of API integration settings)

### How AI messages are identified and ignored by other bots

- AI responses include a very short prefix marker `m@i` at the start of the message body. This is not configurable on purpose and is capped at 3 characters to conserve airtime.
- Other MESH-API instances will ignore messages that start with this marker, preventing bots from talking to each other.
- Each instance also tracks node IDs that have sent AI-tagged messages and ignores further messages from those nodes.

#### What is bot‑looping and why is it a problem?
- Bot‑looping happens when two or more automated agents see each other’s messages as prompts and keep replying back and forth without a human in the loop.
- On a constrained LoRa mesh, this can quickly saturate airtime (especially on LongFast), drain batteries, and crowd out legitimate traffic.
- Loops can be surprisingly hard to break because:
  - Messages may be re‑broadcast via MQTT and multiple gateways, multiplying replies.
  - Nodes can buffer/retry after brief outages, re‑triggering the loop even if you silence one side.
  - Different bots might parse/quote each other in ways that keep producing “valid” prompts.
- MESH‑API mitigations:
  - A fixed 3‑char marker (`m@i`) at the start of AI replies so other instances will ignore them.
  - A memory of node IDs that have emitted AI‑tagged messages to avoid engaging those nodes.
  - Conservative defaults: no LongFast replies by default and MQTT response gating disabled by default.
  - Policy: the AI never initiates conversations or responds to arrival/presence events—only explicit human messages.

## Configuration

Your `config.json` file controls core MESH-API settings — connection, AI, messaging, and emergency alerts. **Integration-specific settings** (Discord, Home Assistant, Slack, Telegram, etc.) are now configured per-extension in `extensions/<name>/config.json`. See the [Extensions System](#extensions-system) section and the WebUI Extensions Manager for details.

Below is the **default** `config.json` with inline explanations:

> **Note:** Discord, Home Assistant, Slack, Telegram, and all other integration-specific settings have been moved to the [Extensions System](#extensions-system). Each extension has its own `config.json` under `extensions/<name>/`. You can manage them via the WebUI Extensions Manager or by editing the files directly.

---

## Home Assistant & LLM API Integration

### Home Assistant Integration

> **Home Assistant is now an extension.** Configure it in `extensions/home_assistant/config.json` or via the WebUI Extensions Manager. See [Extensions System](#extensions-system) for details.

- **Enable:** Set `"enabled": true` in `extensions/home_assistant/config.json`.
- **Configure:** Set the `url`, `token`, `channel_index`, and `timeout` fields in the extension config.
- **Security (Optional):** Enable `"enable_pin": true` and set `"secure_pin"` in the extension config.
- **Routing:** Messages on the designated channel are forwarded to Home Assistant. When PIN mode is enabled, include your PIN in the format `PIN=XXXX your message`.

### LLM API Integration

Set `"ai_provider"` in `config.json` to one of the 12 supported providers, then fill in the corresponding API key / URL / model fields:

- **LM Studio:** `"ai_provider": "lmstudio"` — configure `lmstudio_url`, and optionally set `lmstudio_chat_model` / `lmstudio_embedding_model` if using multiple models.
- **OpenAI:** `"ai_provider": "openai"` — provide `openai_api_key` and choose a model (default `gpt-4.1-mini`).
- **Ollama:** `"ai_provider": "ollama"` — configure URL, model, and optional generation overrides via `ollama_options`.
- **Claude:** `"ai_provider": "claude"` — provide `claude_api_key` (default model `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`).
- **Gemini:** `"ai_provider": "gemini"` — provide `gemini_api_key` (default model `gemini-2.0-flash`).
- **Grok:** `"ai_provider": "grok"` — provide `grok_api_key` (default model `grok-3`).
- **OpenRouter:** `"ai_provider": "openrouter"` — provide `openrouter_api_key` (default model `openai/gpt-4.1-mini`).
- **Groq:** `"ai_provider": "groq"` — provide `groq_api_key` (default model `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`).
- **DeepSeek:** `"ai_provider": "deepseek"` — provide `deepseek_api_key` (default model `deepseek-chat`).
- **Mistral:** `"ai_provider": "mistral"` — provide `mistral_api_key` (default model `mistral-small-latest`).
- **OpenAI-Compatible:** `"ai_provider": "openai_compatible"` — provide `openai_compatible_url`, `openai_compatible_api_key`, and `openai_compatible_model` for any provider with an OpenAI-compatible API.

All providers have a configurable `_timeout` (default 60 seconds).

## Communication Integrations

### Email Integration
- **Enable Email Alerts:**  
  - Set `"enable_smtp": true` in `config.json`.
- **Configure SMTP:**  
  - Provide the following settings in `config.json`:
    - `"smtp_host"` (e.g., `smtp.gmail.com`)
    - `"smtp_port"` (use `465` for SSL or another port for TLS)
    - `"smtp_user"` (your email address)
    - `"smtp_pass"` (your email password or app-specific password)
    - `"alert_email_to"` (recipient email address or list of addresses)
- **Behavior:**  
  - Emergency emails include a clickable Google Maps link (generated from available GPS data) so recipients can quickly view the sender’s location.
- **Note:**  
  - Ensure your SMTP settings are allowed by your email provider (for example, Gmail may require an app password and proper security settings).

### Discord Integration: Detailed Setup & Permissions

> **Discord is now an extension.** Configure it in `extensions/discord/config.json` or via the WebUI Extensions Manager. The setup steps below for creating a Discord bot and permissions still apply.

![483177250_1671387500130340_6790017825443843758_n](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0042b7a9-8ec9-4492-8668-25ac977a74cd)


#### 1. Create a Discord Bot
- **Access the Developer Portal:**  
  Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and sign in with your Discord account.
- **Create a New Application:**  
  Click on "New Application," give it a name (e.g., *MESH-API Bot*), and confirm.
- **Add a Bot to Your Application:**  
  - Select your application, then navigate to the **Bot** tab on the left sidebar.  
  - Click on **"Add Bot"** and confirm by clicking **"Yes, do it!"**  
  - Customize your bot’s username and icon if desired.

#### 2. Set Up Bot Permissions
- **Required Permissions:**  
  Your bot needs a few basic permissions to function correctly:
  - **View Channels:** So it can see messages in the designated channels.
  - **Send Messages:** To post responses and emergency alerts.
  - **Read Message History:** For polling messages from a channel (if polling is enabled).
  - **Manage Messages (Optional):** If you want the bot to delete or manage messages.
- **Permission Calculator:**  
  Use a tool like [Discord Permissions Calculator](https://discordapi.com/permissions.html) to generate the correct permission integer.  
  For minimal functionality, a permission integer of **3072** (which covers "Send Messages," "View Channels," and "Read Message History") is often sufficient.

#### 3. Invite the Bot to Your Server
- **Generate an Invite Link:**  
  Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` with your bot’s client ID (found in the **General Information** tab) in the following URL:
  ```url
  https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&permissions=3072&scope=bot
  ```
- **Invite the Bot:**  
  Open the link in your browser, select the server where you want to add the bot, and authorize it. Make sure you have the “Manage Server” permission in that server.

#### 4. Configure Bot Credentials in Extension Config
Update `extensions/discord/config.json` with the following keys (or use the WebUI Extensions Manager):
```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "webhook_url": "YOUR_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL",
  "receive_enabled": true,
  "bot_token": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN",
  "channel_id": "YOUR_CHANNEL_ID",
  "inbound_channel_index": 1,
  "send_ai": true,
  "send_emergency": true
}
```
- **webhook_url:**  
  Create a webhook in your desired Discord channel (Channel Settings → Integrations → Webhooks) and copy its URL.
- **bot_token & channel_id:**  
  Copy your bot’s token from the Developer Portal and enable message polling by specifying the channel ID where the bot should read messages.  
  To get a channel ID, enable Developer Mode in Discord (User Settings → Advanced → Developer Mode) then right-click the channel and select "Copy ID."

#### 5. Polling Integration (Optional)
- **Enable Message Polling:**  
  Set `"receive_enabled": true` in the extension config to allow the bot to poll for new messages.
- **Routing:**  
  The `"inbound_channel_index"` key determines the mesh channel used by MESH-API for routing incoming Discord messages.

#### 6. Testing Your Discord Setup
- **Restart MESH-API** (or hot-reload via the WebUI Extensions Manager).
- **Check Bot Activity:**  
  Verify that the bot is present in your server, that it can see messages in the designated channel, and that it can send responses.  
- **Emergency Alerts & AI Responses:**  
  Confirm that emergency alerts and AI responses are being posted in Discord as per your extension configuration.

#### 7. Troubleshooting Tips
- **Permissions Issues:**  
  If the bot isn’t responding or reading messages, double-check that its role on your server has the required permissions.
- **Channel IDs & Webhook URLs:**  
  Verify that you’ve copied the correct channel IDs and webhook URLs (ensure no extra spaces or formatting issues).
- **Bot Token Security:**  
  Keep your bot token secure. If it gets compromised, regenerate it immediately from the Developer Portal.

### Twilio Integration
- **Enable Twilio:**  
  - Set `"enable_twilio": true` in `config.json`.
- **Configure Twilio Credentials:**  
  - Provide your Twilio settings in `config.json`:
    - `"twilio_sid": "YOUR_TWILIO_SID"`
    - `"twilio_auth_token": "YOUR_TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN"`
    - `"twilio_from_number": "YOUR_TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER"`
    - `"alert_phone_number": "DESTINATION_PHONE_NUMBER"` (the number to receive emergency SMS)
- **Usage:**  
  - When an emergency is triggered, the bot sends an SMS containing the alert message (with a Google Maps link if GPS data is available).
- **Tip:**  
  - Follow [Twilio's setup guide](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/tutorials/how-to-use-your-free-trial-account) to obtain your SID and Auth Token, and ensure that your phone numbers are verified.

## Other Important Settings

- **Logging & Archives:**  
  - Script logs are stored in `script.log` and message logs in `messages.log`.
  - An archive is maintained in `messages_archive.json` to keep recent messages.
  
- **Device Connection:**  
  - Configure the connection method for your Meshtastic device by setting either the `"serial_port"` or enabling `"use_wifi"` along with `"wifi_host"` and `"wifi_port"`.  
  - For Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connections, set `"use_bluetooth": true` and optionally provide `"ble_address"` with the device MAC address or UUID. Leave `"ble_address"` empty for auto-scan. Requires the `bleak` Python package.
  - Alternatively, enable `"use_mesh_interface"` if applicable.
  - Connection priority: WiFi TCP > Bluetooth BLE > MeshInterface > USB Serial.
  - Baud Rate is optionally set if you need - this is for longer USB runs (roof nodes connected via USB) and bad USB connections.
  
- **Message Routing & Commands:**  
  - Custom commands can be added in `commands_config.json`.
  - The WebUI Dashboard (accessible at [http://localhost:5000/dashboard](http://localhost:5000/dashboard)) displays messages and node status.
  
- **AI Provider Settings:**  
  - Adjust `"ai_provider"` and related API settings (timeouts, models, etc.) for any of the 12 supported providers: LM Studio, OpenAI, Ollama, Claude, Gemini, Grok, OpenRouter, Groq, DeepSeek, Mistral, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
  
- **Extensions:**  
  - Integration-specific settings (Discord, Home Assistant, Slack, Telegram, etc.) are configured per-extension in `extensions/<name>/config.json`. Use the WebUI Extensions Manager to enable, disable, and configure extensions without editing files directly.
  
- **Security:**  
  - If using the Home Assistant extension with PIN protection, follow the specified format (`PIN=XXXX your message`) to ensure messages are accepted.
  
- **Testing:**  
  - You can test SMS sending with your suffixed `/sms-XY` command or trigger an emergency alert to confirm that Twilio and email integrations are functioning.
